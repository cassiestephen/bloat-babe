# Bloat Babe
Bloat Babe is a web application for sharing and discovering recipes that are IBS and stomach issue friendly. It was created using React and Firebase, and styled with a mix of classic CSS and Chakra UI.

# Features and Preview
Bloat Babe features an intro page that gives an overview of the app as the root page.

The user can navigate through the different pages using a nav bar. When the user is not authenticated, a login page is accessible. Google email authentication is used, and the login button gets replaced with a logout button when the authentication is complete.

The feed page can be accessed by any user, whether authenticated or not. It features a search bar to filter through recipes, and each recipe posted has icons symbolizing which dietary restrictions it meets.

# Deploying Bloat Babe on your own device

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
